# Project Guidelines
- Do not create new .md files (e.g., README.md, documentation files) unless explicitly instructed to do so by the user.
- If documentation is required, offer to create it but await explicit confirmation before proceeding.
- If a document is created for a feature, it should be updated when that feature is updated.
- All non-required documents (e.g., STATUS, NEXT_STEPS, CURRENT_SUMMARY) should be created or moved to docs/project_summary
- Do not include emojis in documentation or code
- Review DECISIONS.md for decisions and reasoning behind them
