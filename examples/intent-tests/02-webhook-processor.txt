Natural Language Description (for comparison with glyph notation):

Build a webhook processing service with two endpoints:

1. POST /webhooks/stripe
   - Requires API key authentication
   - Rate limited to 1000 requests per minute
   - Accepts a webhook payload with event type, data, timestamp, and signature
   - Logs every webhook to a webhook_logs table with a generated ID and timestamp
   - Routes events by type:
     - "payment.succeeded" -> update payment status to "completed"
     - "payment.failed" -> update payment status to "failed"
     - "customer.created" -> create a new customer record
   - Returns a confirmation with processed=true and the event ID

2. POST /webhooks/github
   - Requires API key authentication
   - Accepts a webhook payload
   - Logs the webhook with source "github"
   - Returns a confirmation with processed=true and the event ID

Data model:
- WebhookPayload: event (string, required), data (any, required), timestamp (int, required), signature (string, required)
- WebhookResult: processed (boolean, required), event_id (string, optional)
