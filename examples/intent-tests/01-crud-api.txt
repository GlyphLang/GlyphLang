Natural Language Description (for comparison with glyph notation):

Build a REST API for managing Todo items with the following endpoints:

1. GET /api/todos - List all todos from the database
2. GET /api/todos/:id - Get a single todo by ID, return 404 if not found
3. POST /api/todos - Create a new todo with a title (required) and completed status (defaults to false)
4. PUT /api/todos/:id - Update an existing todo's title and/or completed status, return 404 if not found
5. DELETE /api/todos/:id - Delete a todo by ID, return 404 if not found

Data model:
- Todo has: id (int, required), title (string, required), completed (boolean, required), created_at (string, optional)
- CreateTodoInput has: title (string, required), completed (boolean, default false)
- UpdateTodoInput has: title (string, optional), completed (boolean, optional)

All endpoints use a database connection for persistence.
