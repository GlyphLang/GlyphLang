Natural Language Description (for comparison with glyph notation):

Build a background job processing system with queue workers, cron tasks, event handlers, and API endpoints.

Queue Workers:
1. "email.send" - Process email sending jobs. Log each sent email to the database with recipient, subject, status, and timestamp.
2. "report.generate" - Generate reports based on configuration. Query the database for report data, create a generated_reports record with metadata and row count.

Cron Jobs:
1. Daily at 2 AM ("0 2 * * *") "cleanup_expired" - Find all expired sessions and delete them. Return the count of cleaned sessions.
2. Weekly on Monday at 8 AM ("0 8 * * 1") "weekly_digest" - Find all users with digest enabled, gather their activity, and queue a digest email for each.

Event Handlers:
1. "user.created" - When a new user signs up, queue a welcome email with their name.

API Endpoints:
1. GET /api/jobs/:id - Check job status by ID (requires JWT auth, 404 if not found)
2. POST /api/jobs/email - Submit a new email job (requires JWT auth, returns job ID and pending status)

Data model:
- EmailJob: to (string, required), subject (string, required), template (string, required), data (any, optional)
- ReportConfig: type (string, required), date_range (string, required), format (string, required)
